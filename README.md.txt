# 💍 AI-Powered Jewelry Recommendation System  

## 🚀 Overview
This is my **3rd Semester Project** where I developed an **AI-based Jewelry Recommendation System**.  
The system analyzes a user’s **face shape** and **gender** to recommend the most suitable jewelry styles.  

It combines **Machine Learning + Web Development** to provide a personalized recommendation experience.
